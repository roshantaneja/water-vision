### Problem Statement:
In the Monduli District of Arusha, Tanzania, the Maasai communities face acute water scarcity, significantly impacting their daily lives, health, and economic activities. Traditional methods of identifying locations for water harvesting units rely on ground surveys, which are time-consuming and may not accurately capture the dynamic nature of community settlements and water needs. There is a pressing need for an innovative approach to efficiently identify areas with the highest population density and greatest need for water harvesting units. This project proposes the use of computer vision techniques on satellite imagery to address these challenges, ensuring a more effective allocation of resources and maximizing the impact of water harvesting initiatives.

### Project Brief:
**Objective:**
To leverage satellite imagery and computer vision to identify high-density population areas within the Maasai communities in Monduli District, Arusha, Tanzania, where new water harvesting units would be most beneficial.

**Approach:**
1. **Data Collection**: Utilize high-resolution satellite imagery of the Monduli District to capture detailed geographical and infrastructural data.
2. **Computer Vision Analysis**: Implement computer vision algorithms to analyze the satellite images. The focus will be on identifying patterns indicative of human settlements and estimating population densities.
3. **Collaboration with Local Experts**: Work closely with local authorities and community leaders to validate findings and incorporate ground-level insights.
4. **Mapping High-Demand Areas**: Create detailed maps highlighting areas with the highest need for water harvesting units based on population density and current water access.
5. **Project Planning and Implementation**: Use data-driven insights to plan the installation of new water harvesting units strategically. Focus on locations where they will have the most significant impact in terms of accessibility and utility for the largest number of residents.
6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the installed units and adjust strategies based on population movement and changing needs.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Precise identification of areas needing water harvesting units.
- More efficient allocation of resources and quicker implementation.
- Enhanced access to clean water for the Maasai communities, leading to improved health, education, and economic opportunities.
- Creation of a scalable and replicable model for other regions facing similar challenges.
